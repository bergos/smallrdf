# SmallRDF

A small RDF library with minimal dependencies for embedded devices.
It works in memory and requires only memory copy and compare functions.
The library was developed for the Arduino platform, but should work also on other platforms.

## Example

The [SmallHydra](https://github.com/bergos/smallhydra) library contains an example that show how to use SmallRDF.
